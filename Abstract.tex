This paper develops quantitative models that predict the incidence as well as settlement amounts for security class action in US. The datasets originally come from Woodruff-Sawyer \& Co with some significant predictors added manually (e.g., google hits and S\&P 500 return during class period). Time series forecasting methods involving ARIMA and Moving Average were applied for a rough estimate of how many cases will be settled the following month. Afterwards, around a quarter of all variables were selected via various feature selection methods to improve the model. Lastly, predictive algorithms ranging from simple regression methods to advanced ensemble techniques were used and chosen to precisely assess the variance of individual case outcomes revealing substantial amounts given all information prior the settlement date.
